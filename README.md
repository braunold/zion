# Zionism Forum 

Seeing as that so few people want to publish young people exploring the complexities of Zionism today I decided to create a forum for people to do so online. 

The aim of this forum is for people from across the specturm to upload their perspectives and to allow others to comment - simple really.

The pieces uploaded should be your own work, should not just speak about the current political situation but rather pose a question or suggest a viison for Zionism. Nothing is off the table - but it should be thoughtful rather then just a boo or a hurrah.

Authors will be able to state the copywrite status of their piece in terms of republishing et al.
